# DevOps-Task
Description: Configure Jenkins to automate the build, test, and deployment processes for your
application.

1. Automated Testing in CI:
   
• Test Case 1: Integrate a sample application with automated unit tests into the CI
pipeline.

• Expected Outcome: The CI pipeline should run the automated unit tests, and the
pipeline should fail if any tests fail.

. Scheduled Builds:

• Test Case 2: Schedule a periodic build (e.g., nightly build) and verify that the CI pipeline
is automatically triggered at the specified time.

• Expected Outcome: The scheduled build should start automatically, and the CI
pipeline should execute as configured.

3. Rollback Mechanism in CD:

• Test Case 3: Deploy a faulty version intentionally in the CD pipeline, trigger a rollback,
and confirm that the application is reverted to the previous version.

• Expected Outcome: The CD pipeline should detect deployment failure, initiate a
rollback, and the application should be reverted to the last stable version.
